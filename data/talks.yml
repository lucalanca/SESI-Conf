            providers? What kind of sensitive information are “you” making available for

            Nowadays, our education system is based on a step-by-step evolution
            that poses our society with a very slow grade of adaptability.
            Our proposal is to present a complete new way of  teach our students,
            based on the logic envolved in every strategy game from success points
            achieved on every single goal to a healthy competition among them based
            on scores instead of simple grades.  In this system, we could have a
            much greater success of our education system at the same time we keep
            evolving into a new ways of thinking.
            The goal here is to achieve a high level of adaptation to society
            evolution and needs at the same time we grant them access to new
            skills to aproach their own success.
