            Education has always been a hot discussion topic. Recently there’s a lot of fuss on how can we disrupt education; don’t sit down because it’s happening now! 
            This talk will focus on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), starting from their origins, their depth when compared with traditional learning tools (schools), and why we think they will change education and life-long learning.
            Our personal goal is to encourage the audience to embrace MOOC and try them as soon as they find a computer available.

  abstract: |
            Nowadays, our education system is based on a step-by-step evolution that poses our society with a very slow grade of adaptability. Our proposal is to present a complete new way of teach our students, based on the logic envolved in every strategy game from success points achieved on every single goal to a healthy competition among them based on scores instead of simple grades. In this system, we could have a much greater success of our education system at the same time we keep evolving into a new ways of thinking. 
            The goal here is to achieve a high level of adaptation to society evolution and needs at the same time we grant them access to new skills to aproach their own success.

  abstract: |
            Everyday we are offered a load of attractive free services and products, from social networks to free software and games. But behind those services there is always a trade-off: How is your privacy being handled by service providers? What kind of sensitive information are “you” making available for third parties? Can you really guarantee that any of your personal information is never published on the Internet?
            In this talk we are going to answer these questions by analyzing the privacy policies of the most used services nowadays.
